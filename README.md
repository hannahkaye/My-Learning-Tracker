# My Learning Tracker

A progress tracker for my at-home slippercamp (like a bootcamp but a million % less intense because I already have a stressful job.)

## Interests

I'm currently interested in/excited about:

+ Not feeling overwhelmed on Github
+ Hyping FreeCodeCamp
+ Figuring out the best path to put up my 3 website ideas

----

## Feeling Like a "Real Programmer"

What is a real programmer anyways?  Is it someone who derives a paycheck from their work? Is it someone who contributes?  Is it someone like me who goes on Codecademy every day for two weeks and then not again for a year?  I think it can be all of the above.  

I've taken this from the original author of this learning tracker, who took it from [Ginny Fahs'](https://twitter.com/ginnyfahs) ["Things Real Developers Do: My Bucket List"](https://blog.prototypr.io/wondering-if-youre-a-real-developer-yet-try-making-a-bucket-list-281275482155).  I'm adding my own stuff though based on my own personal goals.    


* [ ] Open the computerâ€™s terminal
* [ ] Understand Github
* [ ] Make a personal portfolio website
* [ ] Go to a CodeforGSO hackathon and actually contribute in a meaningful way on programming side not community side
* [ ] Understand 9/10 random XKCD comics
* [ ] Make a game in JS
* [ ] Deploy an app to heroku
* [ ] Read a book about coding
* [ ] Learn at least one Javascript library and incorporate it into a project
* [ ] Get data from an API
* [ ] Hide API keys from the public
* [ ] Post a question on Stack Overflow
* [ ] Push code to GitHub or GitLab or BitBucket or Codepen
* [ ] Complete the entire Python path for Codecademy
* [ ] Complete a technical interview
* [ ] Pay for a subscription to an online learning resource (ie Lynda, TeamTreehouse, Codecademy Pro) and make good use of it.
* [ ] Contribute to an open source project
* [ ] Create a Skyrim mod and add a therapist to Skyrim
* [ ] Derive income from coding
* [ ] Create a web app that could assist therapists in one area of practice
* [ ] Have other people like my code so much they fork it!

### Acknowledgments

I 100% stole this from someone else.  I guess if it's public on Github it's kind of open source so I am not stealing, but I'm actually being efficient, kind of like asking for help on StackOverflow is not cheating.
